# Radar
This is a radar application using mainly Processing IDE and Arduino uno.

### Electronics

Servo motor,ultrasonic sensor,arduino uno,jumper wires

### Programming

Processing is basically an open source graphical library for learning how to code within the context of visual arts.It was used to generate graphical representation of the data form ultrasonic sensor

The servo motor and ultrasonic sensor was programmed using Arduino IDE to rotate with a fixed time period to detect objects in its 3D cone of detection.

### Fabrication

Much simpler,consisting of just an ultrasonic sensor attached on the servo arm with an adhesive tape.
